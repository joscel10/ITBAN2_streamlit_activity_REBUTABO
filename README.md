ACTIVITY 1
This Streamlit app collects an email and a 4-digit PIN, then validates both using regular expressions and simple checks. If the inputs are valid, it shows a success message and displays the email with a masked PIN; otherwise, it shows an error.

ACTIVITY 2
This Streamlit app allows users to upload a CSV file, preview it, and apply filters based on column values, numeric ranges, and missing data handling. It also provides options to view full data, display summary statistics, and download the filtered results. If no file is uploaded, it shows a warning message.

ACTIVITY 3
This Streamlit app is an interactive educational tool that explains key topics in Data Warehousing and Enterprise Data Management, including ETL, integration, governance, and optimization. Users can explore each topic from the sidebar, view diagrams, and access extended content through tabs on real-time analytics, cloud warehousing, and data archiving.

ACTIVITY 4
This Streamlit app is a COVID-19 dashboard that lets users select a country and view the last 30 days of cases, deaths, and recoveries using live data. It provides daily stats, trends, moving averages, and visual summaries through line, bar, and pie charts. Users can also explore raw data and cumulative figures interactively.

ACTIVITY 5
This Streamlit app connects to a MySQL database named "store" using SQLAlchemy and sets up a simple admin login system via the sidebar. It authenticates users by checking if the entered username and password match the predefined credentials ("admin" and "store123").

ACTIVITY 6
This Streamlit app accesses your webcam to display live video and lets you apply real-time filters such as grayscale, blur, Canny edge detection, brightness/contrast adjustment, and sepia. You can take a snapshot of the filtered frame, which is saved locally with a timestamped filename.
